Description: This package evaluates DNA copy number data, using both their 
    initial form (copy number as a noisy function of genomic position) and 
    their approximation by a piecewise-constant function (segmentation), for 
    the purpose of identifying genomic regions where the copy number differs 
    from the normal.
